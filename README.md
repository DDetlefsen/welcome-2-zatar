Welcome to ZATAR's GitHub Repositories
===============

ZATAR's organizational presence on GitHub includes both public and private repositories. The collection of repositories may include our own code projects meant to be distributed to developers as well as forked projects we are contributing to.

If you ever have a question about ZATAR's GitHub repositories or gaining access to them please email **developers@zatar.com**.

<u>**If You Experience GitHub 404 Errors**</u>

GitHub reports a 404 Error when either of the following occurs:
1) You are attempting to access an area you do not have access to
2) You are attempting to access an area you DO have access to, but you are not logged in to GitHub.

If you get a 404 error trying to access one of the ZATAR GitHub repositories, first make sure you are logged in to GitHub using your GitHub username and password (**not your ZATAR account info**). If you are properly logged into GitHub and you still cannot access the repository you are seeking, you must not have access to it. To request access email **developers@zatar.com**.
